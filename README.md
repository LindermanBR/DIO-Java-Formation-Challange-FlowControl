## Flow Control - Challenge
Let's practice all the content presented in the Flow Control module by coding the following scenario.

The system should receive two parameters via the terminal, representing two integers. With these two numbers, you should determine the number of iterations (for) and print the incremented numbers to the console (System.out.print). For example:

- If you pass the numbers 12 and 30, we will have a (for) loop with 18 occurrences to print the numbers, for instance: "Printing the number 1," "Printing the number 2," and so on.

- If the first parameter is GREATER than the second parameter, you should throw the custom exception called ParametrosInvalidosException with the message: "The second parameter must be greater than the first."

1. Create the project DesafioControleFluxo.
2. Within the project, create the class Contador.java to perform all the coding for our program.
3. Within the project, create the class ParametrosInvalidosException, representing the business exception in the system.
